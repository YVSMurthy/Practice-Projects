This folder contains two practice projects

1. A bubble game where the user has to click the displayed bubble number within the given time

2. The second is just the front end of a div showing the current time with the time zone set for India's +5:30 GMT by default. It was for the practice of javascript and the
   buttons and other features are just for the display.
